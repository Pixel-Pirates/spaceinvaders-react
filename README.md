# Space Invaders Demo

This was a short demo and a learning exercise for our UF ECE Senior Project. The project was meant to demonstrate some basic logic without having a fully working prototype yet. We could show how we would do bullet collision, move the invaders, can calculate the score.

See the demo [here](https://pixel-pirates.github.io/spaceinvaders-react/).
